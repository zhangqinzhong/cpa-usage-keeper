# CPA Usage Keeper

[中文说明](./README.md)

CPA Usage Keeper is a standalone CPA usage persistence and dashboard service.

It relies on [CLIProxyAPI (CPA)](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI) as the backend CPA data source and adds persistent storage and statistical analysis capabilities on top of CPA. The service consumes events from the CPA Redis usage queue into SQLite, periodically pulls CPA metadata, exposes aggregation APIs, and serves a built-in web dashboard for usage, pricing, request health, and model/API statistics.

## Features

- Persist CPA usage data to SQLite
- Dashboard for request volume, tokens, cost, cache hit rate, success rate, and latency
- Filter usage details by time range, model, API Key, and source
- Analysis page for token trends, model/API Key/AI Provider composition, and hourly heatmaps
- Standalone API Key usage page for querying usage by CPA API Key
- Credentials page for Auth File and AI Provider usage, with credential quota lookup and refresh
- Maintain model prices for cost estimation and reporting
- Optional password login protection, SQLite backups, Docker/Docker Compose, and systemd deployment

## Quick Start

> Before using CPA Usage Keeper, make sure CPA usage statistics are enabled: `usage-statistics-enabled: true`.

Recommended deployment path:

- First-time CPA + Keeper deployment: use [Docker Compose](#docker-compose-recommended).
- CPA already runs on the host: use [Docker](#docker-cpa-already-runs-on-the-host).
- No containers: use the [Linux binary](#linux-binary).

For public deployments, enable `AUTH_ENABLED=true` and configure `LOGIN_PASSWORD` to protect your data.

## Deployment

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

The repository includes a minimal `docker-compose.example.yml` example for running CPA and CPA Usage Keeper together:

```yaml
services:
  cli-proxy-api:
    image: eceasy/cli-proxy-api:latest
    container_name: cli-proxy-api
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8317:8317"
      - "1455:1455"
    volumes:
      - ./cpa/config.yaml:/CLIProxyAPI/config.yaml
      - ./cpa/auths:/root/.cli-proxy-api
      - ./cpa/logs:/CLIProxyAPI/logs
    networks:
      - cpa-network

  cpa-usage-keeper:
    image: ghcr.io/willxup/cpa-usage-keeper:latest
    container_name: cpa-usage-keeper
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - cli-proxy-api
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      TZ: Asia/Shanghai # Sets the container timezone; log timestamps use this timezone.
      CPA_BASE_URL: http://cli-proxy-api:8317
      CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY: replace-with-your-management-key
      REDIS_QUEUE_ADDR: cli-proxy-api:8317
      AUTH_ENABLED: true
      LOGIN_PASSWORD: replace-with-your-login-password
    volumes:
      - ./keeper:/data
    networks:
      - cpa-network

networks:
  cpa-network:
    driver: bridge
```

Start:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Stop:

```bash
docker compose down
```

CPA files are stored under `./cpa`, and CPA Usage Keeper data is stored under `./keeper`.

### Docker (CPA Already Runs On The Host)

Copy and edit the example config. At minimum, set `CPA_BASE_URL`, `CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY`, `REDIS_QUEUE_ADDR`, `AUTH_ENABLED`, and `LOGIN_PASSWORD`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
```

When CPA runs on the host, `.env` usually needs these values:

```env
CPA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8317
CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY=replace-with-your-management-key
REDIS_QUEUE_ADDR=host.docker.internal:8317
AUTH_ENABLED=true
LOGIN_PASSWORD=replace-with-your-login-password
```

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name cpa-usage-keeper \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v "$(pwd)/keeper:/data" \
  --env-file .env \
  ghcr.io/willxup/cpa-usage-keeper:latest
```

### Linux Binary

#### Download

Download the Linux binary package for your architecture from [Releases](https://github.com/Willxup/cpa-usage-keeper/releases/latest), or use the command line:

```bash
curl -L -o cpa-usage-keeper.tar.gz "<replace-with-linux-binary-download-url>"
mkdir -p cpa-usage-keeper
tar -xzf cpa-usage-keeper.tar.gz -C cpa-usage-keeper --strip-components=1
cd cpa-usage-keeper
```

Copy the `linux_amd64` or `linux_arm64` package URL from Releases, then replace the placeholder in the command above.

#### Configure And Run

Copy and edit the example config. See [Configuration](#configuration) for the available options:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
./cpa-usage-keeper
```

#### Run With systemd

The Linux binary package includes `cpa-usage-keeper.service`, which can be registered directly as a `systemd` service. After it starts, systemd keeps the process running after SSH or terminal sessions close.

`systemd` requires an absolute `WorkingDirectory`. The `sed` command below writes the current directory into the service file automatically:

```bash
sudo cp cpa-usage-keeper.service /etc/systemd/system/cpa-usage-keeper.service # Copy the service file into the systemd unit directory.
sudo sed -i "s|__CPA_USAGE_KEEPER_DIR__|$(pwd)|g" /etc/systemd/system/cpa-usage-keeper.service # Write the current directory as WorkingDirectory.
sudo systemctl daemon-reload # Reload systemd unit files.
sudo systemctl enable --now cpa-usage-keeper # Enable startup on boot and start the service now.
```

Useful commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl status cpa-usage-keeper # Show service status.
sudo journalctl -u cpa-usage-keeper -f # Follow service logs.
sudo systemctl restart cpa-usage-keeper # Restart the service.
```

## Configuration

Copy the example config:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

For first-time deployments, start with "Minimum required" and "Web access and reverse proxy". Most other settings can keep their defaults.

### Minimum Required

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CPA_BASE_URL` | Yes | - | URL used by the Keeper server to call CPA. In Docker Compose this is usually `http://cli-proxy-api:8317`, and it can be a private address or container service name |
| `CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY` | Yes | - | CPA management key used to read CPA management APIs |

### Web Access And Reverse Proxy

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_PORT` | No | `8080` | Keeper HTTP listen port |
| `APP_BASE_PATH` | No | root path | Keeper subpath prefix, such as `/keeper`; empty means `/` |
| `CPA_PUBLIC_URL` | No | current browser origin root | Public CPA URL for the "Back to CPA" link |

`APP_BASE_PATH` must be empty or start with `/`; for example `/cpa`. `/cpa/` is normalized to `/cpa`.

`CPA_PUBLIC_URL` may be a domain, a full URL with scheme, or a relative path, such as `https://cpa.example.com`, `https://cpa.example.com/cpa/`, or `/cpa/`. The frontend appends `management.html` automatically and handles trailing `/` or values that already end in `management.html`. When unset, the "Back to CPA" link points to `/management.html` on the current browser origin. If CPA and Keeper use different public domains, ports, or paths, set `CPA_PUBLIC_URL` explicitly.

`CPA_BASE_URL` is only used by the server to call CPA, so it can be a Docker service name or private network address. Do not use it as the browser navigation URL.

### Login Protection

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AUTH_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Enable login protection |
| `LOGIN_PASSWORD` | When auth is enabled | - | Login password |
| `AUTH_SESSION_TTL` | No | `168h` | Login session lifetime |

### Timezone And Request Behavior

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TZ` | No | `Asia/Shanghai` | Timezone used for statistics and display; Today, daily totals, page timestamps, log timestamps, and daily cleanup are calculated in this timezone |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | No | `30s` | Timeout for CPA HTTP requests and Redis queue operations |
| `TLS_SKIP_VERIFY` | No | `false` | Skip TLS certificate verification for CPA HTTPS and Redis queue TLS; enable only with self-signed certificates |

### Redis Queue Advanced Settings

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `REDIS_QUEUE_ADDR` | No | `CPA_BASE_URL` hostname + `8317` | CPA Redis/RESP TCP address; normally leave empty. Set `host:port` for non-default ports or separately exposed Redis streams |
| `REDIS_QUEUE_TLS` | No | `false` | Use TLS for Redis queue connection; set `true` when `REDIS_QUEUE_ADDR` is explicit and requires TLS |
| `REDIS_QUEUE_BATCH_SIZE` | No | `10000` | Maximum queue records per pull |
| `REDIS_QUEUE_IDLE_INTERVAL` | No | `1s` | Empty queue check interval |

### Storage, Logs, And Backups

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `WORK_DIR` | No | `./data` | Application work directory; database, logs, and backups default to `app.db`, `logs/`, and `backups/` under it |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `info` | Log level |
| `LOG_FILE_ENABLED` | No | `true` | Write persistent log files |
| `LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` | No | `7` | Log retention days; `0` disables cleanup |
| `BACKUP_ENABLED` | No | `true` | Enable SQLite database backups |
| `BACKUP_INTERVAL` | No | `24h` | Database backup interval |
| `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` | No | `7` | Backup retention days |

### Built-In HTTPS

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TLS_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Let Keeper serve HTTPS/TLS directly |
| `TLS_CERT_FILE` | Required when TLS is enabled | - | HTTPS certificate file path |
| `TLS_KEY_FILE` | Required when TLS is enabled | - | HTTPS private key file path |

Usually, HTTPS should be terminated at nginx, Caddy, or another reverse proxy. Set `TLS_ENABLED=true` only when the Keeper process must serve HTTPS directly, and provide `TLS_CERT_FILE` and `TLS_KEY_FILE`; relative paths are resolved against the `.env` file directory.

Security and data notes:

- SQLite database backups store original data from the application database, and backup files are not encrypted.
- Browser-facing APIs redact key-like source/lookup fields or map them to stable public identifiers, but raw database values are unchanged.
- For public deployments, enable `AUTH_ENABLED=true` and terminate HTTPS at your reverse proxy.
- Login sessions are stored in process memory and become invalid after restart.
- Redis inbox raw messages are cleaned up automatically: successful rows are kept until the end of the current day, and failed rows are kept for 7 days.

## Nginx reverse proxy

When serving under `/cpa`, set `APP_BASE_PATH=/cpa` and keep the prefix in your reverse proxy:

```nginx
location /cpa/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}
```

If the CPA management page and Keeper share the same browser domain, and CPA's management page is available at `/management.html` on that domain root, `CPA_PUBLIC_URL` can be omitted. For example, when Keeper is served from `https://cpa.example.com/keeper/`, "Back to CPA" defaults to `https://cpa.example.com/management.html`.

If the CPA management page is on another domain, port, or path, set `CPA_PUBLIC_URL`, for example:

```env
CPA_PUBLIC_URL=https://cpa.example.com
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+
- Node.js 22+
- npm
- A running [CLIProxyAPI (CPA)](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI) instance

### Run locally

1. Create and edit your local config. At minimum, set `CPA_BASE_URL` and `CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY`. If the CPA Redis/RESP port is not the default `8317`, also set `REDIS_QUEUE_ADDR`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
```

2. Start the backend:

```bash
go run ./cmd/server/main.go
```

3. In another terminal, install frontend dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm --prefix ./web ci
npm --prefix ./web run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1
```

The frontend dev server proxies `/api` to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` by default. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173` for local development. If the backend uses another port:

```bash
VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:9090 npm --prefix ./web run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1
```

### Tests

Run the full local verification baseline:

```bash
make verify
```

Or run checks individually:

```bash
go test ./cmd/... ./internal/...
npm --prefix ./web run test
npm --prefix ./web run lint
npm --prefix ./web run typecheck
npm --prefix ./web run build
```
